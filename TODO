Kits:
    - FlatbufferKit (for save/load)

API
    - add extras/optionals param for MustXXX API in zinc cli
    - instead of registering component with entity manager on init func, register with a component registry so 
        that you can call a single method e.g. EntityManager.RegisterComponentsWithRegistry. 
        instead of having call myKit.RegisterMyComponent for every single component for multiple 
        entity managers.
    - write example files for go.doc using example_xxx.go in project root
    - write benchmarks
